# illumio-code-cahllange
This was another great challenge to work on from Illumio.
I ran mulitple test cases on the given set of rules, while testing other randomized unique rules based on the input file, 
some constucted to fail, and others not. 
For this assignemnt I chose to use an unordered_set to store all the unique rules obtained from denormalizing the range of 
each rule recieved from the input file. Finidng a unique rule from this set then occurs near instantly, though this does place a heavy computing task on the constuctor, which i decided in the effort to make accept_package as fast as possible, an acceptable performance loss. 
If I had more time I owuld better structure my code. At the moment I'm using muitlple for-loops to denormlize the rule set which I'm not too pleased with, I'd see if there's more readable way to code it. Also though five for-loops have been used on average 3 of those loops will only run once, making me believe there wa better way to write this.
All the teams sound great and it would be a pleasure to work with. I've applied with the VEN team already and would love to be considered by the Data and Policy teams as well.
